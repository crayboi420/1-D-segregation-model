# 1-D-segregation-model
This is a 1-D solver for temperature and heat diffusion in an alloy undergoing segregation. There are different versions of the model with different working features. The file named 'final model' is the completed model and includes a comparison with an analytical case called the 'Brody Fleming's model'.
